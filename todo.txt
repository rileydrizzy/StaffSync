Your CLI should offer the following:

Add Employee:

Input: Employee ID (integer) and Name (string).

Logic: You must insert the new node in the correct position to maintain the BST property:

IDs smaller than the current node go to the Left.

IDs larger than the current node go to the Right.

Constraint: No duplicate IDs allowed.

Search Employee:

Input: ID.

Logic: Traverse the tree efficiently (go left or right based on the value) to find the employee. Do not check every node.

Output: If found, print the Name. If not, print "Employee not found."

View All (Sorted):

Display all employees sorted by ID (Ascending).

Hint: You cannot sort a list here. You must use In-Order Traversal (Left -> Root -> Right) to print them naturally in order.

Analyze Hierarchy:

Print the "Height" of the tree (how many levels deep the data goes). This is a classic recursion problem.

Exit:

Clean up memory (Free the tree).



Recursion: You must use recursive functions for:

Insertion (insertNode)

Printing (inOrderTraversal)

Height Calculation (calculateHeight)

No Global Head: Try to handle the root pointer inside main and pass it to your functions (e.g., root = insert(root, id, name);)
